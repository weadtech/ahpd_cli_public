The **AHPd Command Line Interface (CLI)** provides a high-performance, platform-agnostic way to integrate the **AHPd** (Analytic Hierarchy Process Data-Driven) decision engine into automated pipelines, scripts, and real-time data processing workflows.

Built on an optimized core, the CLI ensures **100% objective, consistent, and auditable** multi-criteria decision-making based purely on statistical data analysis.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The AHPd CLI executable is named **`ahpd`** (Linux) or **`ahpd.exe`** (Windows).

#### Help Command ‚ùì

To see the list of available commands and options, use the help flag:

```bash
ahpd --help
# or
ahpd.exe --help
```

#### Basic Execution Examples ‚öôÔ∏è

The CLI supports three primary methods for data input: loading from a **file**, receiving via **pipe (standard input)**, or providing data **inline**. In all cases, the input must be a valid AHPd **JSON structure**.

| Input Method | Linux Example | Windows Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **File** | `ahpd json -f phones.json` | `ahpd.exe json -f phones.json` |
| **Pipe (Stdin)** | `cat phones.json \| ahpd json` | `cat phones.json \| ahpd.exe json` |
| **Inline Data** | `ahpd inline -i '{"data":{...}}'` | `ahpd.exe inline -i '{"data":{...}}'` |

## üì• Data Input Structure and Methods

The CLI utilizes subcommands (`json` or `inline`) to specify the data ingestion method, followed by various options to control input, output, and execution mode.

#### Input Commands Reference üìñ

| Command | Description | Input Option |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`json`** | Used for reading JSON data from a **file** (`-f`) or from **Standard Input (pipe)**. | `-f <file_path>` |
| **`inline`** | Used for providing the complete JSON data structure directly as an **inline string**. | `-i '<json_string>'` |

#### Mandatory JSON Structure üìê

The AHPd CLI requires the input data to adhere to a strict structure containing the mandatory keys: **`data`**, **`criteria`**, and **`options`**.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "criteria": {
      "price US$": "min",
      "storage GB": "max",
      "memory GB": "max",
      "camera Mpx": "max",
      "battery mAh": "max"
    },
    "options": {
      "Phone A": [9494, 128, 6, 48, 4323],
      "Phone B": [4139, 256, 8, 50, 4500],
      "Phone C": [4429, 256, 8, 50, 4300],
      "Phone D": [1885, 128, 6, 64, 5065]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Structure Rules üîó

1.  **`criteria` (Object):** Defines the quantitative criteria for the decision.

      * **Keys (Criterion Name):** Must be a **string**.
      * **Values (Preference):** Must be a **string** and restricted to only: **`"min"`** (lower value is better, e.g., price) or **`"max"`** (higher value is better, e.g., performance).

2.  **`options` (Object):** Contains the raw, quantitative data for each alternative.

      * **Keys (Alternative Name):** Must be a **string**.
      * **Values (Data Array):** Must be an **array of numbers** (f64 precision, negatives accepted).
      * **Positional Coherence:** The values in this array **must strictly match** the order of the criteria defined in the **`criteria`** object.

#### Full Inline Example üíª

```bash
# Complete example with inline JSON data
ahpd inline -i '{"data":{"criteria":{"price US$":"min","storage GB":"max","memory GB":"max","camera Mpx":"max","battery mAh":"max"},"options":{"Phone A":[9494,128,6,48,4323],"Phone B":[4139,256,8,50,4500],"Phone C":[4429,256,8,50,4300],"Phone D":[1885,128,6,64,5065]}}}'
```

### Example visual (with Chart.js)

This simple example demonstrates the decision to purchase a device, comparing the features that the **user considers relevant**.

| Option  | price US$ (min) | storage GB (max) | memory GB (max) | camera Mpx (max) | battery mAh (max) |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Phone A  | 9494            | 128              | 6                | 48               | 4323              |
| Phone B  | 4139            | 256              | 8                | 50               | 4500              |
| Phone C  | 4429            | 256              | 8                | 50               | 4300              |
| Phone D  | 1885            | 128              | 6                | 64               | 5065              |

Note that the data was passed **without** any transformation, **without** normalization, **exactly as it is in the real world**.

The user only needed to indicate whether a lower "price" is better or a larger "battery" is better.

The screenshot below intuitively shows the results, allowing you to see **precisely how much each feature (criterion)** contributed to the final ranking score. **This visually validates the weights calculated by AHPd**.

## üì§ Output Formatting and Control

You have control over the level of detail (`--level`), the output destination (`--output`), and formatting (`--pretty`).

#### Output Levels (`--level`) üìà

This option defines which results are included in the JSON output (default is **`rank`**).

| Level Name | Abbreviation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`rank`** | `r` | The final normalized percentage ranking of all alternatives. |
| **`contribution-global`** | `g` or `global` | The automatically calculated **weight/importance** of each criterion. |
| **`contribution-detailed`** | `d` or `detailed` | The percentage contribution of each criterion to each alternative's score (Auditability). |

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Explicitly define desired output levels
ahpd json -f phones.json --level rank contribution-global contribution-detailed

# Use combined or abbreviated forms
ahpd json -f phones.json --level r global
ahpd json -f phones.json --level rgd
```

**Output example:*
```json

#### Output Destination (`--output`) üíæ

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`inline`** | Writes the result to **Standard Output (stdout)** (default behavior). |
| **`<filename>`** | Writes the result to the specified file (adds `.json` if no extension is given). |

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Pretty-print to standard output
ahpd json -f phones.json --pretty --output inline

# Output to a file named 'results.json' with only the detailed contribution data
ahpd json -f phones.json --level detailed --output results.json
```

#### Other Control Options üö¶

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`--pretty`** | Adds formatting (indentation and line breaks) to the JSON output for human readability. |
| **`--check`** | Performs structural **validation** of the input JSON data only. **The AHPd calculation is skipped.** |

**Validation Example:**

```bash
# Structural validation only via pipe
cat phones.json | ahpd json --check
```

## üîé Output Auditability and Precision

The AHPd output is designed to be **consistent, auditable, and highly precise**, relying on **f64 (double-precision floating-point)** numbers for mathematical integrity.

#### Understanding the Output Fields üîç

The JSON output contains three core fields, corresponding to the requested output levels:

1.  **`criteria_weights` (Global Contribution - `g`):** The **automatic weights** (importance) assigned by AHPd based on data dispersion. The sum of all weights equals $1.0$.
2.  **`rank` (Rank - `r`):** The final, normalized **priority vector** (ranking) of each alternative. The sum of all scores equals $1.0$.
3.  **`alternatives_contribution` (Detailed Contribution - `d`):** The full **audit trail** for the decision, detailing how much each criterion contributed to the total score of each alternative.

#### Execution and Analysis Example üß™

**Command Executed:**

```bash
ahpd.exe json -f phones.json --level rdg --output results.json --pretty
```

**Output Analysis (Excerpt from `results.json`):**

| Field/Value | Detail | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`criteria_weights`** | `price US$`: **0.459974** | **Price** received the highest weight (most important factor), meaning its values showed the greatest statistical difference among alternatives. |
| **`rank`** | `Phone D`: **0.336153** | **Phone D is the Winner**. It achieved the highest overall performance score (rank). |
| **`Phone D`** contribution: | `price US$`: **33.34%** | **Auditability:** $33.34\%$ of Phone D's total performance comes from its lower price, which confirms *why* it won‚Äîits strong performance on the most important criterion. |

## üó∫Ô∏è Other Integration Options

While the CLI is ideal for automation, AHPd is platform-agnostic, supporting several integration paths:
